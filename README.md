# What is it?
---
Bracketremover is a simple python script I created while learning python to get used to basic syntax and loops. It reads a file and removes all instances of brackets and everything inside the brackets. Feel free to adapt or use for whatever you wish.
### Compatibility 
---
Bracketremover was designed to be used with python 3 and linux or unix-like operating systems, though it could potentially be used on other operating systems if adapted (this version uses \n for enter, while windows uses \r\n).
### Setup
---
Download the zip and extract to wherever you wish the script to be located.
Create a .txt file with the input using whatever editor you wish
By default, the program checks for a file in downloads called in.txt, but you can specify otherwise.

### Run the script:
---
In terminal change directory to where you stored the script (ex. cd /home/user/Downloads/bracketremover)
Type `python3 ./remove.py`, then enter.
Type full path to the where you stored the input file, or `default` (downloads)
Type full path to the where you want the output file stored, or `default` (downloads)

And you're done!
